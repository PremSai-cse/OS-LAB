AIM: 
To write and execute C programs using various UNIX/Linux system calls to understand 
file handling, process management, and directory operations. 
 
a) Program using stat() System Call 
Aim 
To obtain file information using the stat() system call. 
 
Algorithm 
1. Read file name from the user. 
2. Use stat() to retrieve file details. 
3. Display file size, inode number, and permissions. 
 
Source Code 
#include <stdio.h> 
#include <sys/stat.h> 
int main() { 
    struct stat st; 
    char fname[50]; 
    printf("Enter file name: "); 
    scanf("%s", fname); 
    stat(fname, &st); 
    printf("File size: %ld bytes\n", st.st_size); 
    printf("Inode number: %ld\n", st.st_ino); 
    printf("Permissions: %o\n", st.st_mode); 
    return 0; 
} 
 
 
 
Sample Output 
Enter file name: test.txt 
File size: 120 bytes 
Inode number: 256874 
Permissions: 100644 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Result 
Thus, file information was successfully obtained using stat() system call.
