AIM: 
To write a shell program to display the Fibonacci series up to a given number of terms. 
 
ALGORITHM: 
1. Read the number of terms. 
2. Initialize first two values as 0 and 1. 
3. Display the first two terms. 
4. Use a loop to generate remaining terms. 
5. Display the Fibonacci series. 
 
PROGRAM  
#!/bin/bash 
echo "Enter number of terms:" 
read n 
a=0 
b=1 
echo "Fibonacci Series:" 
echo $a 
echo $b 
for (( i=2; i<n; i++ )) 
do 
  c=$((a + b)) 
  echo $c 
  a=$b 
  b=$c 
done 
 
EXECUTION PROCEDURE: 
1. Create a file fibonacci.sh. 
2. Type the program and save it. 
3. Provide execute permission. 
4. Execute the program. 
 
 
SAMPLE OUTPUT: 
 
Enter number of terms: 
5 
Fibonacci Series: 
0 
1 
1 
2 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
RESULT: 
Thus, the shell program to generate the Fibonacci series was executed successfully.
