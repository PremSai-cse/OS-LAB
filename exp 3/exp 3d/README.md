AIM: 
To write a shell program to find the factorial of a given number. 
 
ALGORITHM: 
1. Read a number from the user. 
2. Initialize factorial value to 1. 
3. Use a loop to multiply numbers from 1 to the given number. 
4. Display the factorial. 
 
PROGRAM: 
#!/bin/bash 
echo "Enter a number:" 
read n 
fact=1 
for (( i=1; i<=n; i++ )) 
do 
  fact=$((fact * i)) 
done 
echo "Factorial of $n is $fact"  
 
EXECUTION PROCEDURE: 
1. Create a file factorial.sh. 
2. Enter and save the program. 
3. Provide execute permission. 
4. Run the program.

SAMPLE OUTPUT: 
Enter a number: 
5 
Factorial of 5 is 120 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
RESULT: 
Thus, the shell program to find the factorial of a number was executed successfully.
